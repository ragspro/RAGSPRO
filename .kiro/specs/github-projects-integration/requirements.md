# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add additional project cards to the existing projects page by including more projects from the user's GitHub/Vercel deployments. The existing 4 projects (GLOW, Himshakti, LAWAI, Maid Service) will remain unchanged, and new projects will be added using the same card design and layout.

## Glossary

- **Projects Page**: The existing `/projects` page that displays portfolio projects
- **Project Card**: Individual project display component showing project details with image, title, description, and links
- **Additional Projects**: New projects to be added: main, RAGSPRO, SAPD, Elito premium shoes
- **Existing Projects**: Current 4 projects that must remain unchanged: GLOW, Himshakti, LAWAI, Maid Service
